## 1. Strategy Overview

### Monetization Layers

| Layer | Product | Revenue Type |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Layer 1** | Free Guide | Email capture (no direct revenue) |
| **Layer 2** | Master Class ($47) | Direct sale |
| **Layer 3** | Affiliate Links | Per-click/commission |

### Strategy Rationale
- Layer 1: Build trust, capture leads
- Layer 2: Primary revenue (direct sale)
- Layer 3: Secondary revenue stream (bonus)

## 2. Planned Affiliate Approach

### Hybrid Placement Strategy

| Guide | Approach | Links Included |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| **Free Guide** | Minimal (trust-first) | 3-5 "start here" essential tools |
| **Master Class** | Comprehensive (value-bonus) | All 62 tools + alternatives |

### Rationale
- **Free Guide:** Readers need to trust us first. Too many affiliate links feels "salesy."
- **Master Class:** Buyers expect comprehensive value. Links are a valuable bonus.

## 3. Disclosure Requirement

**Must include in both guides:**

> "This guide contains affiliate links. We may earn a commission at no extra cost to you when you make a purchase through our links."

Placement:
